Please don't do this. Databases are not particularly well suited to storing large bits of data like images, files, etc.

Instead: you should store your images in a dedicated static file store like Amazon S3, then store a LINK to that image in your MongoDB record.

This is a lot better in terms of general performance and function because:

It will reduce your database hosting costs (it is cheaper to store large files in S3 or other file services than in a database).
It will improve database query performance: DBs are fast at querying small pieces of data, but bad at returning large volumes of data (like files).
It will make your site or application much faster: instead of needing to query the DB for your image when you need it, you can simply output the image link and it will be rendered immediately.
Overall: it is a much better / safer / faster strategy. 


OLD PACKAGE.JSON
"scripts": {
    //"dev": "next dev",
    "dev": "node server.js",
    "build": "next build",
    //"start": "next start",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js",
    "lint": "next lint"
    
   
  },
added "type": "module", in package.json no clue wtf is that


npm run test to run tests!
